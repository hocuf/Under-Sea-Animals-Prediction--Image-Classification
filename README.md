Most life forms began their evolution in aquatic environments. About 90% of the world's living space is provided by the oceans in terms of volume. Fish, which are only found in water, are the first known vertebrates. Some of these transformed into amphibians, which dwell both on land and in water for parts of the day. A few subgroups of one group of amphibians, which also included sea turtles, seals, manatees, and whales, developed into reptiles and mammals. Some underwater habitats are supported by plant life that grows in the water, such as kelp and other algae. The base of the ocean food chain is made up primarily of phytoplankton, which are important primary producers.
